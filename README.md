This project is an end-to-end API built with Flask and Python that processes thermal images to:

Predict a person's stress level based on the thermal image (currently using a dummy model).
Generate a heatmap to visualize temperature variations in the image using color gradients.
The API allows users to upload thermal images, processes the images through the ThermalImageProcessor class, and returns a predicted stress level as well as a heatmap.
