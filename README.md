Thermography, or Thermal Imaging is a modern/innovative technique which 
creates heat-map of different portions in human body by using infra-red (IR) radiation 
where color scales varies for temperature region. This project scope looks to extend the 
broader applications of thermal imaging with state-of-the-art machine learning algo
rithms in conjunction with Azure API services. It is also deployed with this model to 
analyze the thermal images and return scores based on how suitable that region are. The 
methodology of the project consists in data collection, pre processing and generating 
heatmaps for better visualization results based on resource utilization as well integration 
with AI models using Azure’s Custom Vision Api to detect anomalies and classify health 
conditions. There are also applications where Azure Health Insights can be used to pre
pare personalized health reports, which allows the system to adapt itself towards individ
uals quite a lot. This is a project that allows an individual as well as healthcare profes
sionals to have a quick, non-invasive diagnostic tool the which empowers health moni
toring and preventive care. It combines the capabilities of contemporary technologies 
with uses directed towards health practice, leading to inimical patient outcomes and true 
practices as well — such being defined.
